    affects only users who are configuring Lwt as part of a manual installation
    (i.e., not users of opam or esy). See discover.ml for usage (#700).
  * Lwt_unix.async_method will have no effect. In practice, it already does

===== 4.0.0 (2018-03-30) =====

====== Breaking ======

These changes were announced in Lwt 3.1.0 and Lwt 3.2.0. See #453 about smooth
upgrade paths.

  * Delete package lwt.ppx. The PPX syntax is in package lwt_ppx since Lwt 3.2.0
    (#338).
  * Remove >> syntax from the PPX (#495).
  * Delete modules Lwt_log, Lwt_daemon, Lwt_log_core, and package lwt.log. These
    are in package lwt_log since Lwt 3.2.0, but it is recommended to use
    Logs_lwt from the logs library instead (#484, initiated Hannes Mehnert).
  * Delete package lwt.preemptive. It is an alias for lwt.unix since Lwt 3.2.0
    (#487).
  * Delete package lwt.syntax. The Camlp4 syntax is in package lwt_camlp4 since
    Lwt 3.2.0 (#370).
  * Delete module Lwt_chan, a predecessor of Lwt_io (#441).
  * Delete package lwt.simple-top, a predecessor of utop (#371).
  * Make resolvers (Lwt.u) contravariant (#458).

    a forever-pending promise. Also applies to Lwt.choose, Lwt.npick,
    Lwt.nchoose, and Lwt.nchoose_split (#562, Tim Reinke, prompted Hezekiah
    Carty).
  * Remove translation of [%lwt ...] to Lwt.catch from the PPX (#527).
  * Remove -no-debug option from the PPX (#528).

====== Bugs fixed ======

  * Restore backtrace support (#554, #556, Gabe Levi).
  * Serious logic error that could cause Lwt to hang or crash (#549, reported
    @koen-struyve).

  * Documentation improvements (#544, #546, #547, #553, #559, Daniil Baturin,
    Jason Evans, Jess Smith, Milo Turner).

===== 3.2.1 (2018-01-11) =====

Lwt 3.2.1 is released because it still packages lwt.ppx, a deprecated copy of
package lwt_ppx, and the two packages should be kept in sync.

====== Deprecations ======

  * All PPX options are deprecated and should not be used (#534).
  * The [%lwt ...] PPX syntax should be replaced by Lwt.catch (#534).

====== Fixes ======

  * Clean up PPX -help usage message output (#525, Zan Doye).

====== Miscellaneous ======

  * More thorough testing (#512, #535, Joseph Thomas).
  * Clarification of the C binding (#521, @cedlemo).

====== Planned to break in 4.0.0 ======

See #453 for details and instructions about planned breakage in Lwt 4.0.0.

  * The semantics of Lwt will be adjusted for better exception and stack safety
    (#500).
  * The PPX will be factored out into its own opam package, lwt_ppx. This
    package is installable from opam now, as of Lwt 3.2.0 (#338).
  * Similarly, the deprecated Camlp4 syntax will be factored out into
    lwt_camlp4, which is installable from opam now (#370).
  * Modules Lwt_log, Lwt_log_core, Lwt_log_rules, and Lwt_daemon are being
    deprecated and factored out into opam package lwt_log, also installable from
    opam now. Use the logs library for logging, in particular module Logs_lwt.
    Direct daemonization is deprecated on most platforms (#484, Hannes Mehnert).
  * The >> construct from the PPX will be deleted (#471, Raphaël Proust).
  * Package lwt.preemptive is being merged into lwt.unix. In 3.2.0,
    lwt.preemptive becomes an alias for lwt.unix, and the package name
    lwt.preemptive will be deleted in 4.0.0 (#487).

====== Deprecations ======

  * Lwt.waiter_of_wakener should not be used, as it can lead to soundness bugs
    in future (but not current) Lwt (#458).
  * Lwt_sequence was deprecated in Lwt 2.6.0, but it now has a warning attached,
    as do Lwt.add_task_r and Lwt.add_task_l, which use it (#361).
  * Use of the following functions is discouraged, but they have not yet
    received deprecation warnings: Lwt.with_value, Lwt.cancel, Lwt.state,
    Lwt.ignore_result (#359, #469).

====== Miscellaneous ======

  * Replace references to Camlp4 in the manual with the PPX (#457, Bobby
    Priambodo).

  * Improve string messages in exceptions (#368, #382, Jan Doms, Raphaël
    Proust).
  * Don't call Unix.set_nonblock or Unix.clear_nonblock unnecessarily on
    some fds (#356, David Sheets).
  * Lwt_unix.sleep and Lwt_unix.timeout returning too early when using
    libev (#433, Stijn Devriendt).
  * Lwt_sequence.fold_r iterating the wrong way in some cases (#405,
    Stijn Devriendt).
  * Build conflicts in some cases due to duplicate cst_to_constr
    function (#362, Jérémie Dimino).
  * Don't use deprecated readdir_r system call (#430, Raphaël Proust).

====== Miscellaneous ======

  * The Lwt core, lwt.ml, has been thoroughly refactored and commented
    (#354, reviewed Gabriel Radanne, Edwin Török, Raphaël Proust, Jan
    Doms, Fabian Hemmer, Sebastien Mondet, Simon Cruanes, Anil
    Madhavapeddy, Pierre Chambart, and many others).
  * Lots of tests for most of the Lwt core (#339, #389, #392, #440,
    #448, #450, Joseph Thomas, Ryan Slade).
  * Documentation fixes (including by Joseph Thomas, Raphaël Proust,
    Richard Degenne, Stavros Polymenis).
  * Contributing documentation (#379).
  * Massively adjust whitespace for legibility (#400, #409, #416,
    Richard Degenne).
  * Improvements to CI (Etienne Millon, Raphael Rafatpanah, Zack Coker,
    Yotam Barnoy).
  * The additional packages lwt_ssl, lwt_react, lwt_glib get new minor
    releases, the change being new Jbuilder build systems (#374, Andrew
    Ray).

  * Lwt_engine.libev now has an optional argument for selecting the libev back
    end (#269, #294, Jeremy Yallop).
  * Lwt_io.establish_server has been changed to make it more difficult to leak
    file descriptors (#258, #260).
  * Lwt_io.shutdown_server now evaluates to a promise, which completes when the
    listening socket's close(2) operation completes (#259).
  * Lwt_unix.bind now evaluates to a promise, because the bind(2) system call
    can block for Unix domain sockets (#296, requested David Sheets).
  * ocamlfind packages lwt.react, lwt.ssl, lwt.glib are replaced by lwt_react,
    lwt_ssl, lwt_glib. These have been separate OPAM packages, under those
    names, since 2.7.0 (#301).

===== 2.7.1 (2017-04-08) =====

====== Fixes ======

  * OCaml 4.05 compatibility (Mauricio Fernandez, #322).
  * Give Lwt_unix.file_exists the same semantics as Sys.file_exists, with
    respect to not raising Unix.Unix_error (Mauricio Fernandez, #316).
  * Improve diagnostics from build scripts (Tim Cuthbertson, #313, #314).

====== Additions ======

  * Announce Lwt_result, which was originally released as an experimental module
    in release 2.6.0 (Simon Cruanes, #320, #247).

===== 2.7.0 (2017-01-03) =====

====== General ======

  * Values of types a Lwt.t are now referred to as promises rather than threads
    (#300). The manual has not yet been updated.

    changes will first require deprecation, then a major version number increase
    (#293).
  * Lwt no longer supports OCaml 4.01 (#272).
  * Lwt_unix.fdatasync is no longer available on macOS. It was calling an
    undocumented system call on that system (#285, Jeremy Yallop).

====== Planned to break in 3.0.0 ======

  * APIs in this category have deprecation messages attached. The messages will
    be displayed if you recompile your code, and can also be seen in #308.
  * Lwt_engine.libev will have an argument for selecting the libev back end
    (#269, #294, Jeremy Yallop).
  * Lwt_io.establish_server will be replaced by a version that makes it
    difficult to leak file descriptors (#258, #260).
  * Lwt_io.shutdown_server will evaluate to a promise, which indicates when the
    close operation completes (#259).
  * Lwt_unix.bind will evaluate to a promise, since bind can block for Unix
    domain sockets (#296, requested David Sheets).
  * ocamlfind packages lwt.react, lwt.ssl, and lwt.glib will be replaced by the
    new lwt_react, lwt_ssl, and lwt_glib. These are now distributed in new OPAM
    packages with the same names, separately from OPAM package lwt (#301).

====== Additions ======

  * Lwt_unix.readv and Lwt_unix.writev - zero-copy scatter/gather I/O
    (#291, #299).

    immediately push all elements into the created streams
    (#239, Spiros Eliopoulos).

    standard result type (#295).

====== Bugs fixed ======

  * Ungraceful failure if directory handle used after Lwt_unix.closedir (#292).
  * Buffer overflow in Lwt_unix.readdir and Lwt_unix.readdir_n (#292).
