  /** The state machine is comprised of two arrays.

      The [states] array represents the different states and the associated
      transitions:
      - The first cell is the header cell, [states[s]].
      - If the header is equal to [0],
        The remaining cells are the transitions characters, sorted
        alphabetically.
      - If the header is positive,
        This is a final state, [states[s]] is the result of the sequence.
        In this case, [edges[s]] must be equal to [1].
      - If the header is equal to [-1],
        This is a final state, the remaining cells represent the result string
        which starts at index [s + 1] and has a length of [edges[s] - 1].

      The [edges] array represents the transition state corresponding to each
      accepted inputs.
      - If [states[s]] is a header cell, [edges[s]] is the number of cells
        occupied by the state [s], including the header cell.
      - If [states[s]] is a transition, [edges[s]] is the index of the state to
        jump into.
      - If [states[s]] is a part of a final state, [edges[s]] is not used. */
