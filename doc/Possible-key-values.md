# Key values

A key value defines what a key on the keyboard does when pressed or swiped.

Key values appear in the following places:

- In custom layouts, they are the value of: the `c` attribute, the compass-point attributes `nw` ... `se`, and the old-style `key0` ... `key8` attributes.
- Internally, they are used in the definition of the "Add keys to the keyboard" setting.

Key values can be any of the following:

- The name of a special key. A complete list of valid special keys follows.

- An arbitrary sequence of characters not containing `:`.
  This results in a key that writes the specified characters.

- The syntax `legend:key_def`.
  `legend` is the visible legend on the keyboard. It cannot contain `:`.
  `key_def` can be:
  + The name of a special key, as listed below.
  + `'string'` An arbitrary string that can contain `:`. `'` can be added to the string as `` \' ``.
  + `keyevent:keycode` An Android keycode. They are listed as `KEYCODE_...` in [KeyEvent](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/KeyEvent#summary).

  Examples:
  + `⏯:keyevent:85` A play/pause key (which has no effect in most apps).
  + `my@:'my.email@domain.com'` A key that sends an arbitrary string

- A macro, `symbol:key_def1,key_def2,...`.
  This results in a key that behaves as if the sequence of `key_def` had been pressed in order.

  Examples:
  + `CA:ctrl,a,ctrl,c` A key with legend CA that sends the sequence `ctrl+a`, `ctrl+c`.
  + `Cd:ctrl,backspace` A key with legend Cd that sends the shortcut `ctrl+backspace`.

## App function keys
These keys are sent to apps, which are free to ignore them. The keyboard does not perform editing in response to these keys.
